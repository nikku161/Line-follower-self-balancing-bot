# Line-follower-self-balancing-bot
How do you make a robot follow a line? Now what if the robot has only two wheels. How will it balance and follow the line? 
The concepts of line-following and self-balancing, using ESP32, a powerful micro-controller with features like inbuilt Wi-Fi support and BLE, with extensive application in several domains like IoT, RF, etc are used in the project.
The project entails various essential concepts such as PID Control, Embedded Communication Protocols, PWM, Filters, RTOS, etc.

Following are some of the highlights:
ESP-IDF, the official IoT Development framework by espressif.
Motor Control with PWM and PID.
Accelerometer , gyroscope and complimentary filter.
Communcation protocols ( UART , SPI , I2C )
